# FME Workbench

Let's take a closer look at FME Workbench. You can locate Workbench in the Windows start menu:

{% import "../includes/templates.html" as template %}

{% call template.tip() %}

<p>Feel free to follow along in Workbench during these informational sections if you wish. Alternatively, you can just complete the hands-on exercises in each unit, which will illustrate the concepts shown between exercises.</p>

<p>If you are using a virtual machine provided for training, we recommend opening Workbench now, as the first time opening on a new machine takes a moment.</p>

## Major Components of FME Workbench ##

The FME Workbench user interface has many major components:

### Canvas ###

The FME Workbench canvas is where to define a translation. It is the primary window within Workbench:

By default the workspace reads from left to right; data source on the left, transformation tools in the center, and data destination on the right. Connections between each item represent the flow of data and may branch in different directions, merge together, or both.

### Menu/Toolbar ###

The menu bar and toolbar contain many tools: for example, tools for navigating around the Workbench canvas, controlling administrative tasks, and adding or removing readers/writers:
