      Workspaces define translations. Workspaces contain reader(s) and writer(s), which control how data is read and written. Each reader and writer has feature type(s), which are logical groupings of features, the atom of FME data. For spreadsheet data, feature types are tables and features are rows; for spatial data, feature types are layers and features are single geometric features like points, lines, or polygons.
