       Which of the following is an example of schema editing or mapping? Check all that apply.
    </p>
    <answer>You create a workspace that removes observations from a CSV file if they are older than a target date.</answer>
    <answer correct>You create a workspace that joins customer data from a CRM to social media exposure data gathered by your Social Media Manager.</answer>
    <answer correct>You create a workspace that adds updated AutoCAD drawings to a centralized Esri ArcGIS geodatabase, removing three unwanted attributes and renaming two others in the process.</answer>
    <answer>You create a workspace that extracts a group of records from an Oracle database based on a spatial filter.</answer>
    <explanation>Removing records (by an attribute value like observation date or spatial location) does not count as schema editing or mapping. Although the  content of the written data is changed, its structure remains the same. In the CRM example, joining data adds new attributes. In the AutoCAD example, attributes are removed or renamed. These operations are schema editing, because you are changing the structure of the final dataset.</explanation>

    <p>
      Why is the input port on the <code>Date</code> attribute of the writer feature type red?
    </p>
    <answer>The feature type's User Attributes tab did not appropriately define attribute parameters.</answer>
    <answer>FME is not connected to system date-time.</answer>
    <answer>The <code>Date</code> attribute on the reader feature type is not exposed.</answer>
    <answer correct>There is a <code>Date</code> attribute defined on the writer schema, but it has no value.</answer>
    <explanation>We created a <code>Date</code> attribute on the writer schema by adding it to the User Attributes tab. However, there is nowhere in the workspace - either in the read data or data created with transformers - to supply values to this attribute. Therefore, it displays with a red color.</explanation>
