The planning department likes the HTML summary report made earlier. They can use that to show an overview of all the 3-1-1 calls. However, they also want an Excel spreadsheet broken into separate sheets for each planning area to send to local planners. We'll create that for them in this exercise.

{% call template.tip() %}

Remember that for Excel, FME feature types correspond to Excel workbook sheets (i.e., tables).

# 1) Conduct a Fanout on the Excel Writer Feature Type

We could manually add 23 distinct Excel feature types, but that would be very inefficient. Instead, we can make use of a **feature type fanout**.

Double-click on the 311-requests-summary writer feature type to open its parameters. Telling FME to write separate files is as simple as setting an attribute to the file name. Click the drop-down arrow next to Sheet Name and select Attribute Value > `Local Area`:

![](./Images/fanout.png)

Click OK to make the change and then select the Excel writer feature type and use Run To This to write out the separate files.

# 2) Inspect Fanout Results

Click the Open Containing Folder button. Now in C:\\FMEData2019\\Output\\Training\\311-requests-summary.xlsx you should see 23 separate sheets, each with the name of a local area:

Now we can supply these this file to the local planners that need it.

<ul>
  <li>Conduct a feature type fanout</li>
</ul>
