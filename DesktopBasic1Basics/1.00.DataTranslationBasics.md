# Data Translation Basics #

At its heart, FME is a data translation tool, and this is usually the first aspect users wish to learn about.

**Data translation** is the term we at Safe Software use to refer to the conversion of data from one format to another. Have you ever had trouble opening data in an unusual format in your go-to application? Have you ever needed to load spreadsheet data into a database in a systematic way? Have you ever wanted to extract and convert web data in formats like HTML, JSON, and XML with no coding? Then you have come to the right place! FME makes data conversion easy, allowing you to translate between over 400 different formats.

We refer to **translation** rather than **conversion** to emphasize the goal of seamlessly letting data speak in the language of a different format. FME is designed to let you not just convert data from one format to another, but to create output data to your exact specifications.

In this unit, you will learn how to conduct basic data translations yourself using FME.
