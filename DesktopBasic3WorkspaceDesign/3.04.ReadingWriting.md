# Reading and Writing Workflows #

By default, the Generate Workspace dialog creates a workspace with a single reader and a single writer. However, this does not mean the workspace is forever limited to this. Additionally, FME can read/write data using:

- Multiple readers, multiple writers, or both
- FeatureReader and/or FeatureWriter transformers *(Covered in the next chapter)*
- Integration transformers such as the DropboxConnector, Email, HTTPCaller, etc.
