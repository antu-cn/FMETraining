# Workspace Testing Techniques #

When developing a workspace incrementally, or making edits to a structured workspace, a lot of testing will take place. Each time a change is made the author will wish to test the change, and this process of change/test repeats itself again and again.

To effectively and efficiently carry out this process, there are a number of tools available in FME Workbench.

The first set of tools are for inspecting data as it changes. The second set of tools are for defining which parts of the workspace need to be tested.
