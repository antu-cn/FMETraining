# Module Review #

This module was designed to introduce you to a broader range of FME transformers, plus techniques for applying transformers more efficiently.


## What You Should Have Learned from this Module ##

The following are key points to be learned from this session:


### Theory ###
- There are distinct groups of transformers that do work other than transforming data attributes or geometry
- FeatureReader and FeatureWriter transformers read and write data at any point in a workspace
- Integrated editing dialogs allow the author to replace transformers with built-in functions
- A large proportion of the most-used transformers are related to attribute-handling
- Filtering is the act of dividing data. Conditional filtering is the act of dividing data using a test or condition
- Data joins are carried out by transformers that merge data, from within Workbench or from external data sources



### FME Skills ###
- The ability to locate a transformer to carry out a particular task, without knowing about that transformer in advance
- The ability to use FeatureReader and FeatureWriter transformers
- The ability to read data from and write data to, web services
- The ability to build strings and calculate arithmetic values using integrated tools
- The ability to use common transformers for attribute management
- The ability to use transformers for filtering and dividing data
- The ability to use transformers for merging data together
