  <question>
    <p>
    Look at this screenshot of an editing dialog and tell me what the value returned to the attribute will be:
    <br><br><img src="./Images/Img4.021.AttributeManagerMissVectorQuestion.png"></p>
    <answer correct>2+2</answer>
    <answer>4</answer>
    <answer>4.0</answer>
    <answer>Error!</answer>
    <explanation>The key is to notice that the header of this dialog says "Text Editor". Therefore the value returned to this attribute will be the literal string "2+2". If the user wishes to add 2+2 to get 4, they should have used the arithmetic editor!</explanation>

  <question>
    <p>
      Which is the BEST transformer to use, if you wanted to test for a Yes/No value?
    </p>
    <answer correct>Tester</answer>
    <answer>ExpressionEvaluator</answer>
    <answer>AttributeManager</answer>
    <answer>AttributeFilter</answer>
    <explanation>The Tester can be set up easily to test one value TestAttribute=Yes. Where as the ExpressionEvaluator is used for math operations, the AttributeFilter is better for testing multiple values and the AttributeManager takes a bit longer to set up a conditional value.

  <question>
  <p>Look at the following screenshot, then answer how many features will appear in the output connection...
  <br><br><img src="./Images/Img4.061.FeatureMergerQuestion.png"></p>
  <answer>Eight (8)</answer>
  <answer>Eighteen (18)</answer>
  <answer>Twenty-six (26)</answer>
  <answer correct>Can't tell</answer>
  <explanation>It's impossible to tell from the screenshot, because you don't know how many attribute values will be a match. Because there are eight fire halls it will be anywhere from zero to eight, but that's all we can tell. In fact if it was a FeatureJoiner transformer there could be as many as 144 matches, if every fire hall somehow matched to every postcode boundary!</explanation>
