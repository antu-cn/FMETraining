You've applied to become an **[FME Certified Professional](https://www.safe.com/partners/certification/)**. To help you practice for the exam, your colleagues have given you some questions to test your knowledge of searching for and selecting transformers.

Can you answer them?


<br>**1) Most-Used Web Transformers**
<quiz name="">
  <question multiple>
    <p>
      The first thing your colleagues want to know is, what are the top 5, most-used transformers in the Web category?
    </p>
    <answer correct>HTTPCaller</answer>
    <answer correct>JSONFlattener</answer>
    <answer>AttributeManager</answer>
    <answer correct>ParameterFetcher</answer>
    <answer>SalesforceConnector</answer>
    <answer>Clipper</answer>
    <answer correct>Generalizer</answer>
    <answer correct>JSONFragmenter</answer>
    <answer>SNSSender</answer>
    <explanation> You can find this out through the <a href="https://www.safe.com/transformers/#/">Transformers Gallery</a> on the Safe Software web site.
    <br>Although the Generalizer seems an odd web transformer, it can be used to reduce the number of vertices in geometry, making features smaller and more suitable for use on the web.

<br>**2) Quick Add**
<br>Here is what appears to be a list of random characters, which transformers are returned by Quick Add for each string of random characters?:

    <answer>AttributeExternal</answer>
    <explanation>An example of a string that is too long. "eexpl" would be more efficient</explanation>
  </question>

</quiz>

<br>**3) Transformer Searching**
<br>Thirdly, your colleagues have come up with a list of different scenarios, and want you to search for a transformer to carry them out. Remember, there are often many ways to carry out a task in FME:

<quiz name="">
  <question>
    <p>We have some lines of text in a file and want to read that text and add it as an attribute.</p>
      <answer correct>AttributeFileReader</answer>
      <answer>CoordinateSwapper</answer>
      <answer>PointCloudThinner</answer>
      <answer>StringLengthCalculator</answer>
      <answer>NeighborPairFinder</answer>
      <explanation>The AttributeFileReader reads the contents of a file and stores them as the value for the specified attribute.</explanation>
  </question>

  <question>
    <p>We have a set of addresses and for each address want to find the closest two libraries.</p>
      <answer>AttributeFileReader</answer>
      <answer>CoordinateSwapper</answer>
      <answer>PointCloudThinner</answer>
      <answer>StringLengthCalculator</answer>
      <answer correct>NeighborPairFinder</answer>
      <explanation>The NeighborPairFinder finds the closest two Candidate features within some maximum distance of each Base feature and some minimum separation in heading between the Candidates and the Base.</explanation>
  </question>

  <question>
    <p>We have a point cloud dataset and want to reduce its size by resampling it to remove excess points.</p>
      <answer>AttributeFileReader</answer>
      <answer>CoordinateSwapper</answer>
      <answer correct>PointCloudThinner</answer>
      <answer>StringLengthCalculator</answer>
      <answer>NeighborPairFinder</answer>
      <explanation>The PointCloudThinner outputs point cloud features that have fewer points than the original input features. This transformer is typically used to reduce data volume by identifying a set of points to keep and discarding the remaining points.</explanation>
  </question>

  <question>
    <p> We have a text string and want to find out how many characters the string contains.</p>
      <answer>AttributeFileReader</answer>
      <answer>CoordinateSwapper</answer>
      <answer>PointCloudThinner</answer>
      <answer correct>StringLengthCalculator</answer>
      <answer>NeighborPairFinder</answer>
      <explanation>Finding out a value usually needs to calculate the answer, so these transformers often end in the word "Calculator". Here we want to find the length of the string, hence StringLengthCalculator.</explanation>
  </question>

  <question>  
    <p>We have a set of vector contours and want to create a cross-section by transposing the X and Z coordinates.</p>
      <answer>AttributeFileReader</answer>
      <answer correct>CoordinateSwapper</answer>
      <answer>PointCloudThinner</answer>
      <answer>StringLengthCalculator</answer>
      <answer>NeighborPairFinder</answer>
      <explanation>The CoordinateSwapper swaps coordinate axes of the input features.</explanation>
  </question>
