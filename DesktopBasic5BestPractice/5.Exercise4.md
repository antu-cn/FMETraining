A regional GIS group is holding an FME Hackathon, and you have been invited to take part.

You have been provided with a set of source data and asked to create a useful project from it. You decide that it would be interesting to produce a tool that maps the route from the hackathon venue to a cafe where a group get-together will be held that evening.

So, your task is to use the data available to you to calculate the best route from the convention center to the cafe and to write out that data to GPX format so people can use it in their GPS/mobile device.

---

**1) Create Database Connection**
<br>The source data has been provided in a PostGIS database; therefore our first task should be to create a connection to it. That way we can use the connection instead of having to enter connection parameters.

In a web browser visit [http://fme.ly/database](http://fme.ly/database) - this will show the parameters for a PostGIS database running on Amazon RDS.

In FME Workbench, add a PostGIS reader, then for the Connection, click the drop-down and select Add Database Connection. Then in the Add Database Connection dialog, enter the connection parameters obtained through the web browser for the PostGIS on Amazon RDS database. For Name enter Hackathon PostGIS Database:

![](./Images/Img5.220.Ex4.DatabaseConnectionDialog.png)

Click Save. Click on Parameters to select the table we want to read from the database, select the public.CompleteRoads table. Then click OK twice to add the reader to the canvas.

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">PostGIS</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">Hackathon PostGIS Database</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Parameters</td>
<td style="">Table List: public.CompleteRoads</td>
</tr>

</table>

<!--Tip Section-->

<table style="border-spacing: 0px">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;background-color:darkorange;border: 2px solid darkorange">

To add a connection without first adding a reader, select Tools > FME Options from the menu bar.
<br><br>
Click on the icon for the Database Connections category, then click the [+] button to create a new connection. In the "Add Database Connection" dialog, first, select PostgreSQL as the database type. Then enter the connection parameters obtained through the web browser.
<br><br>

The completed workspace for this exercise uses a database connection called <strong>Hackathon PostGIS Database</strong>
<br>If you wish to open/use this workspace, you should create your connection with the same name. That way when you open the workspace, it will automatically find a matching connection.
<br><br>This is a good illustration of the importance of naming conventions for database (and web) connections.
</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

**2) View the Data**
<br>Click on public.CompleteRoads feature type to open the popup menu. Then click the View Source Data button to view the data in Visual Preview.

You will see a set of road features each of which has a set of attributes. One attribute specifies whether a feature represents a one-way street. It's important to know this if we want to calculate a route that is actually legal!

![](./Images/Img5.221.Ex4.SourceRoadsData.png)

***Note:*** *If you have any problems using the PostGIS database - for example connectivity problems with a firewall - then the following AutoCAD dataset can be substituted with very few changes required:*

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">Autodesk AutoCAD DWG/DXF</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2019\Data\Transportation\CompleteRoads.dwg</td>
</tr>

</table>


<br>**3) Add GPX Writer**
<br>Now that we know that we read in the correct table, let's prepare the writer. Add a GPX Writer to the canvas with the following parameters:


<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Format</td>
<td style="">GPS eXchange Format (GPX)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2019\Output\Training\Route.gpx</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Feature Types</td>
<td style="">Select All</td>
</tr>

</table>


Following the best practices that were covered in this chapter, add bookmarks around the reader feature type and all of the writer feature types. The workspace will look like this:

![](./Images/Img5.222.Ex4.InitialWorkspace.png)

GPX is a fixed-schema format, hence the six different writer feature types that are automatically created.


<br>**4) Add ShortestPathFinder**
<br>Now we need to start calculating a route. The obvious first step is to add a ShortestPathFinder transformer, which is how we can calculate our route.

So, add a ShortestPathFinder transformer. Connect public.CompleteRoads to the Network port.


<br>**5) Add Creator**
<br>The other input port on the ShortestPathFinder is for the From-To path (the start and end points of our journey). There are many ways to create this - or even accept input from a web map - but here we'll manually create a feature with the Creator transformer.

So, add a Creator transformer and connect it to the From-To port:

![](./Images/Img5.223.Ex4.CreatorOnCanvas.png)

Inspect the Creator's parameters.

Firstly enter UTM83-10 as the coordinate system of the data we are about to create. For the Geometry Object parameter, click the [...] browse button to the right to open a geometry-creation dialog. Select Line as the geometry type and enter the following coordinates:

<pre>
X      Y
491500 5459550
494500 5457440
</pre>

The first coordinate is that of the hackathon venue and the second is the closest point in our network to the cafe we're going to visit.

![](./Images/Img5.224.Ex4.CreatorParams.png)

Click the OK button to confirm the changes.


<br>**6) Check ShortestPathFinder Parameters**
<br>The coordinates of the feature we've added might not sit exactly on the road network. To get around this issue, there are parameters we can use in the ShortestPathFinder.

So, inspect the ShortestPathFinder parameters. Under Snap Options set **From-To and Network Snapping** to *Yes* and enter *150* as the **Snapping Tolerance**:

![](./Images/Img5.225.Ex4.SPFSnapParameters.png)

Also, notice that there are parameters for network costs - we'll be making use of those later.


<br>**7) Run Workspace**
<br>Ensure feature caching is turned on and run the workspace. Check the log and then inspect the ShortestPathFinder:Path cache. If all has gone well, the output will look like this, with a route defined:

![](./Images/Img5.226.Ex4.SPFInitialRoute.png)
<br><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:x-small">Map tiles by <a href="https://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC-BY-3.0</a>. Data by <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC-BY-SA</a></span>.

If you don't see a path like this one, you must make use of your debugging skills to try and locate the error!


<br>**8) Add AttributeValueMapper**
<br>The result looks fine, but there are some things we are still uncertain about: for example, what if the route uses slower, residential roads? We can force the route to prefer arterial routes by applying a different cost to each road feature.

The cost will depend on the road type. We need to map road type to cost, and the way to do that is with an AttributeValueMapper transformer.

Add an AttributeValueMapper transformer to the workspace between the CompleteRoads feature type and the ShortestPathFinder:Network port:

![](./Images/Img5.227.Ex4.AVMOnCanvas.png)


<br>**9) Edit AttributeValueMapper**
<br>Inspect the AttributeValueMapper's parameters. Enter the following values:

<table>
<tr><td style="font-weight: bold">Source Attribute</td><td align=center>roadtype</td></tr>
<tr><td style="font-weight: bold">Destination Attribute</td><td align=center>Cost</td></tr>
<tr><td style="font-weight: bold">Default Value</td><td align=center>2</td></tr>
</table>

![](./Images/Img5.228.Ex4.AttributeValueMapperParams1.png)

Now, underneath those parameters, we'll map some data.

<table>
<tr><th>Source Value</th><th>Destination Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>Arterial</td><td align=center>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Residential</td><td align=center>3</td></tr>
</table>

![](./Images/Img5.229.Ex4.AttributeValueMapperParams2.png)

If the route is arterial (a main road) it will get a cost of 1, residential routes will get a cost of 3, and all other types will get a cost of 2 (because that's the default value). Click Accept/OK to confirm the parameters.


<br>**10) Apply Costs**
<br>Now we have to apply the costs we have just created. Inspect the ShortestPathFinder's parameters. Enter the following values:

<table>
<tr><td style="font-weight: bold">Cost Type</td><td align=center>By Two Attributes</td></tr>
<tr><td style="font-weight: bold">Forward Cost Attribute</td><td align=center>Cost</td></tr>
<tr><td style="font-weight: bold">Reverse Cost Attribute</td><td align=center>Cost</td></tr>
</table>

---

<!--Tip Section-->

<table style="border-spacing: 0px">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;background-color:darkorange;border: 2px solid darkorange">
<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-lg fa-pull-left fa-fw" style="color:white;padding-right: 12px;vertical-align:text-top"></i>
<span style="color:white;font-size:x-large;font-weight: bold;font-family:serif">TIP</span>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="border: 1px solid darkorange">
<span style="font-family:serif; font-style:italic; font-size:larger">
Why "Two Attributes"? That's because with only a forward cost, I could only ever travel along a stretch of road in the same direction as the vertices are arranged in. Since I don't want to avoid roads based on their vertex direction, using two attributes tells FME the cost is the same in both directions.
</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

Now re-run the workspace to see if there is any difference in the result. It should look like this:

![](./Images/Img5.230.Ex4.WeightedRoute.png)
<br><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:x-small">Map tiles by <a href="https://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC-BY-3.0</a>. Data by <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC-BY-SA</a></span>.

So the cost weighting has made a difference. But there is a problem with this result...

</td>

<tr>
<td style="border: 1px solid darkorange">
<span style="font-family:serif; font-style:italic; font-size:larger">
The route is taking a longer path this time, and I can see a reason why that might be: cost is being used to weight routes <strong>instead</strong> of the distance, not as well as.
<br><br>To explain this, let's say I want to travel from A to B. There is a single <strong>residential</strong> road feature that starts at A and ends at B, with a route distance of 1.5 kilometres.
<br><br>There is also a single <strong>arterial</strong> road feature that starts at A and ends at B. Rather extremely, it loops around the dark side of the moon with a route distance of 768,000 kilometres.
<br><br>Currently our solution would choose the 768,000 kilometre trip, because it has a cost of "1" compared to the residential route cost of "3"!
<br><br>Plainly, the exercise data here is nowhere near as ridiculous, but it's equally plain that the route might not be the optimum until distance is factored back into the result.
</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

<br>**11) Add AttributeManager**
<br>Add an AttributeManager transformer between the AttributeValueMapper:Output port and the ShortestPathFinder:Network port and view the parameters.

In the value field for the Cost attribute, click the drop-down arrow and select Open Arithmetic Editor. In that dialog enter the expression:

<pre>
@Value(Cost)*@Length()
</pre>

![](./Images/Img5.231.Ex4.ExpressionEvaluatorParams.png)

In short, we're now multiplying cost by road length to give us a combined weighting.

Re-run the translation to see if it makes a difference:

![](./Images/Img5.232.Ex4.DistanceWeighted.png)
<br><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:x-small">Map tiles by <a href="https://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC-BY-3.0</a>. Data by <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC-BY-SA</a></span>.

Yes, it does, proving that the route was longer than necessary. Of course, the expression we've used is subjective and could be made more complex to give a better result. For example, we could try a logarithmic scale instead to see what that produced.


<br>**12) Edit AttributeManager**
<br>Regardless of our expression, there's another last problem to investigate: one-way streets. Currently, we have no solution in place to prevent us from driving the wrong direction.

Luckily each one-way street is flagged with an attribute and has its vertices ordered in the direction of permitted travel, so we know which way to avoid. Let's use this information to solve that problem.

We'll need to calculate different cost attributes for each direction now, although the value will only differ when a one-way street is involved. There are - as usual - multiple ways to handle this in FME; let's go with a moderately easy one.

View the AttributeManager parameters again. This time create a new Output Attribute called ReverseCost. In the value, field click the drop-down arrow and choose Conditional Value.

<!--Tip Section-->

<table style="border-spacing: 0px">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;background-color:darkorange;border: 2px solid darkorange">
<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-lg fa-pull-left fa-fw" style="color:white;padding-right: 12px;vertical-align:text-top"></i>

</tr>

<tr>
<td style="border: 1px solid darkorange">
<span style="font-family:serif; font-style:italic; font-size:larger">
Conditional Values are those that are set dependent on a test condition. It's like incorporating a Tester into the AttributeManager. These are covered in more detail in the FME Desktop Advanced training course.
</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

In the definition dialog that opens, double-click in the first "If" row and a Test Condition dialog opens. In here set up a test for oneway = Y. For the Output Value (bottom of the dialog) enter the value 9999 (for example, the cost of traveling the wrong way is *really* expensive)!

![](./Images/Img5.233.Ex4.ConditionalCostY.png)

Click OK to close that dialog. Back in the previous dialog, double-click where it says &lt;No Action&gt; choose the dropdown arrow and select Attribute Value &gt; Cost:

![](./Images/Img5.234.Ex4.ConditionalCostConditions.png)

Click OK again twice more to close these dialogs.

Now one-way streets have a prohibitively high reverse cost, while other streets just receive the usual forward cost.


<br>**13) Apply Cost**
<br>We have created a ReverseCost attribute, but we still need to use it. Check the ShortestPathFinder parameters and change the ReverseCost attribute from Cost to ReverseCost:

![](./Images/Img5.235.Ex4.SPFReverseCost.png)

Now we're ready to go. Re-run the workspace. You could inspect the ShortestPathFinder:Path output port to see the results. However, if you want to see the **actual** written output, you will have to drag and drop the .gpx file onto Visual Preview. You can then specify to read the data with an LL83 coordinate system, as that information is not stored in GPX files:

![](./Images/Img5.235b.Ex4.SpecifyCoordinateSystem.png)

In either case, you should see the correct output:

![](./Images/Img5.236.Ex4.FinalOutput.png)

There is one change (above) caused by a route that previously traveled the wrong-way (west-east) along a street that is one way (east-west)!


<br>**14) Connect Schema**
<br>Connect the Path port to the Route output feature type:

![](./Images/Img5.237.Ex4.FinalWorkspace.png)

Now run the workspace, upload the data to your GPS device, and you are ready to go!
