## Course Etiquette ##


For online courses, please consider other students and test your virtual machine connection *before* the course starts. The instructor cannot help debug connection problems during the course!

For live courses, please respect other studentsâ€™ needs by keeping noise to a minimum when using a mobile phone or checking e-mail.
