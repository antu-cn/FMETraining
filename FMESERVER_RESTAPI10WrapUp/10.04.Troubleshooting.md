## FME Server REST API Error Codes ##

The FME REST Service returns an HTTP status code for every request. For most GET requests, a response message is returned in your requested format, along with the status code. For most PUT and DELETE requests, only the status code is returned to indicate whether the operation is successful or not. Refer to the specifications reference for more details. All of these codes can be found on the [REST API documentation page](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_REST/apidoc/v3/index.html).
