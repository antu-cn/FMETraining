### 2.2 Understanding the REST API Response

The response structure is very similar to the request structure. This
features the response body, response code, and the response header.

#### Response Body

Most calls to the FME Server will result in a response. This is what
makes the FME Server REST API a very powerful tool. With this response,
you may automate another process to run. The Response Body
will always be in JSON.

#### Response Code

The request above should result in a code 200 which is outlined in the
example call:

##### Potential Response Codes

Below there is a table listing common response codes. For a full list,
please visit the
