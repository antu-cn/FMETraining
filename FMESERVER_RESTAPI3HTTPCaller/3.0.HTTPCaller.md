## Chapter 3- Using a REST Client Tool to Make Calls to the FME Server

Now that you understand what the REST API is and how the calls and responses work; it's time to start interacting with the FME Server.

For the purposes of this training course, we will use an external tool named Postman which can be downloaded here: https://www.getpostman.com/apps _(this is already on the training computers)_.

If there is another REST client tool you are familiar with you may use that as an alternative, but the instructions in this manual will refer to the Postman interface.

#### Why use a REST Client tool?

A REST Client is a medium to practice calls with. The client accepts the REST calls and will communicate directly with the FME Server. There are several reasons why a user will use a REST Client tool:

- Easy to use interface to input calls  
- Save the calls and use them later 
- Can generate code snippets from the calls to use in applications

I use Postman to test calls before using them in the HTTPCaller Transformer in FME Workbench. By using the REST API calls in FME Workbench I can automate many FME Server processes.
