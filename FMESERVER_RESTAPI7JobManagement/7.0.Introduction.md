### Chapter 7- Job Management

Job queues are a mechanism for sending jobs to specific FME Engines. The reasons for using job queues include:

- Controlling the priority of job requests.
- Sending a job to an FME Engine in close proximity to a data source.
- Sending a job to an FME Engine that supports a particular format.
- Reserving an FME Engine for a scheduled task.
- Reserving an FME Engine for quick jobs.

When you create a job queue, you assign one or more FME Engines to the queue. (You can assign an FME Engine to more than one queue.) Then, when you run a job, you can specify which queue and, therefore, which engines to handle the job. If you create multiple job queues with different priority levels, higher priority queues submit job requests before lower-priority queues, depending on timing.

By extension, you can also assign a repository to a queue. By default, all jobs are assigned to the queue of their respective workspace repository, unless another queue is specified for the job.

All engines and repositories must be assigned to a queue. If an engine or repository is not assigned to a queue explicitly, it is assigned to the Default queue.
