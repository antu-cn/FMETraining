Although the actions may seem odd in regard to the name – Publications receive messages, Subscriptions send them – it is correct. They are named in relation to how they interact with Topics. <br>So, a Publication <strong>publishes</strong> data to a topic (i.e. it sends data to a topic) and a Subscription <strong>subscribes</strong> to a topic (i.e. it receives data from the topic).
