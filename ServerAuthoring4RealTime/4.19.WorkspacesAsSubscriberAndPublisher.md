## Workspaces as a Subscriber AND a Publisher ##

We've now looked at how to set up a workspace to be a Subscriber (reacting to incoming messages) and how to set up a workspace as a Publisher (sending outgoing messages). A workspace can do each task individually, but when it is set as both a Subscriber and a Publisher, the overall setup looks like this:

In this scenario, the same workspace that receives an incoming notification also sends an outgoing notification. It is set up as a Subscriber with a Subscription component in order to receive incoming notifications and set up as a Publisher by registering it with the notification parameters on a different service.

For example, details of a lightning strike are received via a LightningStrike topic. A Publication watching for this topic starts a workspace that processes the incoming information; for example, it determines which state/province/county the strike occurred in. The workspace then creates a new message and dispatches it to subscribers via a WeatherAlert topic.

The important thing to realize is that the scenario must involve at least two different topics.

A major problem occurs if you set up such a scenario but attempt to use the same topic for both incoming and outgoing messages. That’s because the workspace would be set up as a subscriber to each message that it is publishing! It would republish each of its outgoing messages, causing an infinite loop of messages!

Using the same topic for incoming and outgoing notifications is like setting up your email to forward all incoming messages to yourself, or automatically re-tweeting your own tweets. You end up with a loop that continues until you crash the system!
<br><br>To avoid confusion it’s a good idea to clarify which topics are for in and out communication through their names; for example, use LightningStrike_In and LightningStrike_Out to differentiate.
