**Data Streaming: Zipped Output**

If the Data Streaming service does not provide a dataset, but a zip file, then the following may be of help.

- If the output format is one composed of a number of files – for example, Esri Shape – then the Data Streaming service will create a zip of the output.
- Often raster Writers will write an additional World file, and vector Writers a prj file, in order to preserve coordinate system information, and this can unexpectedly cause this issue. In most cases, wld/prj file creation can be turned off with either Writer or Feature Type parameters.
