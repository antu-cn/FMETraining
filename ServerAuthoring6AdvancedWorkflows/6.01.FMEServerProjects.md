# FME Server Projects

A Project in FME is a way to group FME Server items in a way that mimics a real-world project.

Grouping items together allows them to be handled together in a single action. For example, a workspace author can back up their work with a single action by grouping together the relevant parts as a project.

## Project Components ##

A project can incorporate most FME Server items, including common ones such as:

- Workspaces
- Custom Transformers
- Repositories
- Schedules
- Notification Components
- Resources
- Web, Database, and Resource Connections
- Users and Roles


## Project Uses and Advantages ##

Projects have a number of primary uses:

- Backups
- Migrations
- Sharing


### Backups ###

The Backup tools on FME Server allow the entire FME Server to be backed up by an administrator.

However, a Project allows a workspace author to create backups of content they created (without being an administrator) and allows that author to pick which components are included in the backup (it does not need to be the entire server).


### Migrations ###

In a similar way to backups, an administrator can transfer an entire FME Server onto a new server setup, but sometimes a workspace author needs to be able to transfer just their work to a different FME Server instance.

Projects allow an author to migrate their work between machines without the assistance of an administrator.


### Sharing ###

The system administrator has access to security functions on FME Server to control who has permission to use various components and resources. Authors also have the ability to share repositories that they have created with other users.

However, a project usually consists of more than just workspaces and an FME Project allows an author to share multiple components instead of just a single repository.
